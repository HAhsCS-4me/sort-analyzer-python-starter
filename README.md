# Instructions
Compare and analyze the performance of the Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort on various types of data.

Use the Sort Functions you have created to gather data on how long each sort algorithm takes to sort the various data arrays.  I would recommend running each sort a number of times and taking an average of the sort times. 

The start code creates the following arrays from provided data files:
1. Random Array: 10,000 random values.
2. Reversed Array: 10,000 down to 1.
3. Nearly Sorted Array: 1 to 10,000 with some values out of place.
4. Few Unique Array: all 5,000 except some values different.
